# Implementation of simple Logistic Regression Model <br/><br/>
## Dataset: Customer Telephonic Churn Dataset<br/>
### Model: Predicting whether Customer will continue Telephonic service or not<br/>
### Libraries used:<br/>
**Numpy** - For numpy arrays<br/>
**Matplotlib** - For plotting<br/>
**Pandas** - To read data<br/>
**Scikit-Learn** - For F1_score, Accuracy score, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix<br/>
*scikit-learn is not used for predicting modelling, parameters have been learnt by writing code from scratch*<br/>

### Description
- Train and Test set has been splited in ratio 80:20. Training has been done on train set.
- Model selection has been using maximum F1 score by trying various Learning Rates.
- Number of Iterations has been kept equal to 20000.
- Test set has been used to calculate error rate on unknown set.
